# modena

Domain names are expensive and creating new deployment pipelines/scripts takes a precious time you could be dedicating to something else (e.g. learning [functional programming](https://drboolean.gitbooks.io/mostly-adequate-guide-old/content/)). Instead of having a separate environment for each of your express apps, use modena to expose all of them on a single express server while keeping them isolated from each other.

Please visit the [examples repository](https://github.com/L3bowski/modena-v2-examples) to get a better understanding on how to use modena
